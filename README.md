# Creep_life_DCSA

DCSA - Divide and Conquer Self-Adaptive ensemble algorithm. 
This repository contains the implementation of the DCSA for predicting the creep rupture life of various P91 grade steel alloys.

Key Features:

Implements DCSA framework with clustering + specialised ML models.

Benchmarks against baseline models:
Neural Networks
Support Vector Regression (SVR)
Random Forest (RF)
Ridge Regression

Handles log-scaling of target values for numerical stability.

Exports results and comparisons to Excel for easy analysis.

Results:
DCSA consistently outperforms baseline ML models in R² and RMSE, demonstrating improved generalisation for unseen test data.
